# Pathway Browser Router - Implementation Plan

## Overview

**Purpose**: A lightweight URL routing agent that opens URLs in the appropriate browser/profile based on configurable rules.

**Core Principle**: Simple, predictable, and fast. Portable dotfiles-like configuration.

## Current Status

✅ **Milestone 1 Complete**: Core CLI with URL validation
- Basic Rust CLI that validates and logs URLs
- URL validation with scheme restrictions
- Structured logging with `tracing`
- Comprehensive test suite

✅ **Milestone 2 Complete**: Browser discovery & launch
- Detects common browsers per-platform and reports system default
- `--browser`, `--channel`, and `--system-default` flags control routing
- `--list-browsers`, `--check-browser`, and `--no-launch` add diagnostics
- Launches URLs via platform-appropriate commands with verbose command logging
